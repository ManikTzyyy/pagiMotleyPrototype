          <h2>The Pagi Motley Story</h2>
          <p>
            Our story began in 2019, I Made Andika Putra who was experienced
            work in natural dye and textile about 20 years dare his self to
            resign and then build a small studio in the north of Bali. Not an
            instant way, our journey full of roller coaster memory. Andika quit
            from his comfort zone just because he wants to contribute to his
            born land. He saw that more and more young people were leaving the
            villages to work in the city and he eager to empowering local
            community to stay and develop the local genus as the potential
            sector.
            <br /><br />
            Just in line, Andika also wants to increasing the people awareness
            of the dangerous chemical usage on textile. As the man who work on
            the textile field for two decades, he well known about the chemical
            usage dangerous on the textile. The waste that thrown directly in to
            the soil will infiltrate and kill the ecosystem inside the soil. The
            confection that we wear in the day long without we realize it will
            be absorb by the skin through the pore. In long time it will be a
            serious health problem. From that several issues Pagi Motley was
            established to provide a solution with the small step but consistent
            movement.

            <h3>Etymology</h3>
            <p>
              Pagi Motley was construct by two words, Pagi and Motley. In Bahasa
              Indonesia Pagi means morning, in deep meaning morning was the
              beginning of the day, where all the new energy was begun. Motley
              build from English word with means multi color or heterogeneous.
              So, in combine Pagi Motley means the beginning of het-erogeneous.

                The technology today is developing so fast. All the human desire
                can be fulfilled quickly. For example, in the textile sector,
                fashion trends and fashion mode can change quicker than we
                think. That's why many companies have been established, both
                large and micro companies, producing cloth to fulfill the
                fashion need. Therefore the company are compete to dominate the
                market. They use the latest technology to reduce production
                cost, for example using chemical to generating color. But did
                you know the bad side effects of this technological (Fast
                Fashion) to the future of human life? As someone who works in
                the textile for long time, I really understand how the cloth dye
                process using chemicals are very dangerous both for human health
                and environment. Chemical waste are very difficult to recycle,
                so they are thrown directly into nature. The cost of disposing
                is cheaper than recycling. This is what will cause environmental
                pollution which will gradually become very dangerous for human
                life.
                <br /><br />Based on this, I was moved to make a small change,
                by introducing natural colors to the wider community so that I
                could reduce the use of chemical colors on textile. The natural
                colors are obtained from plants, which is from leaves, stems,
                fruit and roots. The dye waste we are reprocess to become
                fertilizer and we giving back to the plants. <br /><br />
                I am optimistic that the results of natural colors will compete
                to chemical colors. Therefore, help me to show to the wider
                community the results of the natural colors that I have produced
                today. The more speakers there are, the more people will hear,
                so we can reduce the impact of chemical colors on environment as
                soon as posible
